## üë§ Student Information
- **Name:** Senthil Kumar Ramamoorthy
- **University:** University of Central Missouri
- **Program:** MS in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

## üìÇ Assignment Overview

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Tensor Operations & Reshaping
- Performed basic tensor operations using TensorFlow
- Used `tf.reshape()` to manipulate tensor shapes
- Demonstrated broadcasting and arithmetic operations

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Loss Function Comparison
- Implemented Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE)
- Compared both loss functions using sample predictions
- Visualized results using a bar chart (Matplotlib)

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Neural Network with TensorBoard Logging
- Trained a simple neural network on MNIST dataset
- Logged training progress with TensorBoard
- Visualized training and validation accuracy/loss

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Execute each cell step by step
3. For Task 3, launch TensorBoard using:
   ```python
   %load_ext tensorboard
   %tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
